This assignment is set up to work only on the localhost level.
Multiple libraries were used to get this working on the localhost level whose links have been provided in the web.php file.
If there are any errors in running the code please do get in touch with me using naveen.gnanapazham@mavs.uta.edu
Download the zip file provided and read README.txt
Make sure php is on your device.

Steps to Follow:
1. create a folder named "imagesuploaded" in any directory.
2. cd your way into "imagesuploaded" directory from your terminal or shell.
3. Run 'php -S 127.0.0.1:8000' in your terminal or shell.
4. open your local browser and type in "http://localhost:8000/web.php".
5. Hopefully Everything worked out.
6. Once encryption and decryption is done all the files from "imagesuploaded" will be removed so you have to start
over for doing the encryption of another images again.


Disclaimers:
1. The encrypted file will be stored inside the "imagesuploaded" file. Once Encryption is done you can look in the folder
for file named 'encrypted_image.png'.
2. Only JPG, PNG and JPEG can be uploaded as a file.
3. Text entered in the box will be stored in a text file named "mydata.txt".

Future Implementation of the project:
1. Setup a website with a login system and verification system.
2. Subscribe to service which has database hosting.
3. Provide all encrypted images on the homepages under a tab.
4. Once user has logged in they encrypt and decrypt their own files.
5. Users need to have permission from owner of the encrypted file on the common tab to decrypt it.
